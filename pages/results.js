            Check the energy rating of your appliances and convert to more
            energy-efficient appliances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optimise the use of appliances, such as setting the temperature of
            your fridge to 4 or 5 degrees Celsius and temperature of the freezer
            to -15 to -18 degrees, and only running your dishwasher when it is

            One easy way to reduce your consumption of high impact animal-based
            products is to reduce your portion sizes.
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            To cut back on meat portions even further, try mixing higher
            emission-impact proteins like beef with low emission-impact
            proteins, for example by adding beans to stews or soups and halving
            the meat content. This is also a great way to save money, as legumes
            like beans are cheap to buy in comparison to meat.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you still want to eat meat, try consuming more fish, chicken and
            pork, as they create less emissions than other livestock such as
            beef or mutton.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use tools like the Sustainable Seafood Guide from GoodFish to help
            make better and more sustainable decisions about what seafood to

            Check the energy rating of your appliances and convert to more

          <li>
            Optimise the use of appliances, such as setting the temperature of
            your fridge to 4 or 5 degrees Celsius and temperature of the freezer
            to -15 to -18 degrees, and only running your dishwasher when it is

            Every degree above 20 degrees in heating can add 10% to your heating
            bill. In winter, set your thermostat to between 18 and 20 degrees.
            In summer, set your thermostat to 26 degrees or above.

            One easy way to reduce your consumption of high impact animal-based
            products is to reduce your portion sizes.
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            To cut back on meat portions even further, try mixing higher
            emission-impact proteins like beef with low emission-impact
            proteins, for example by adding beans to stews or soups and halving
            the meat content. This is also a great way to save money, as legumes
            like beans are cheap to buy in comparison to meat.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you still want to eat meat, try consuming more fish, chicken and
            pork, as they create less emissions than other livestock such as
            beef or mutton.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use tools like the Sustainable Seafood Guide from GoodFish to help
            make better and more sustainable decisions about what seafood to
            purchase.

            The easiest way to reduce emissions from travel is to use public

            Minimise your vehicle use, such as performing several errands in one

          </li>

            Try walking or cycling to your nearest shops, rather than driving.
